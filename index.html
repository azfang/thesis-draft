            My first memory is of stealing.

                Stealing a small plastic rosary, later draping its string of translucent beads around my neck. I didn't
                understand what I had taken from the other girl. It weighed almost nothing in my hands.

                I threw away the rosary that same afternoon, before anyone else had realized what I had done. <img src="media/star4.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon1">

            At the age of 25 I wrote and rewrote the details of this memory, until I was left only with the taste of
            certain words.

            “It is not the object but the name that creates desire; it is not the dream but the meaning that sells,”
            <img src="media/star2.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon2">
                Barthes writes. Manufactured desire circulates through a system that turns garments into aspirations, objects into
                ideals. The larger fashion industry operates as a semiotic field, where items of dress and their
                representations are imbued with cultural significance. A social code of signs and symbols, words and
                images seducing us, conspiring against us.
            <div class="indent">
                We are always left wanting.
            </div>
            <div class="indent">
                It is through textual interpretations, Barthes argues, that fashion first acquires
                ideological value. Opening a
                fashion magazine to any page, the reader first experiences a garment through its photographed
                representation, then encounters "the same garment, but described, transformed into language; [...] a
                leather belt, with a rose stuck in it, worn above the waist, on a soft shetland dress; this is a written
                garment." <img src="media/star6.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon3">
            </div>
            <div class="indent">
                Unlike the real garment, which has a practical use, the written garment exists entirely to signify
                fashion as a concept. Text and image, the designer’s primary mediums, allow for the reproducibility of
                the object of desire as well as the myths, the constructed meanings, through which longing condenses and
                forms. As designers and as cultural laborers, I often wonder how we are entangled with—and at times,
                implicated within—this system.

            This past year, I drifted in and out of various archives.
            <div class="indent">
                While working at the International Library of Fashion Research last summer, I asked a researcher what
                drew ordinary visitors into these spaces. "Sometimes this is the only way people gain access to this
                world,
                through printed matter," she responded. I began watching the way other visitors handled the archival
                materials: delicately, almost with reverence.
                <!-- The ephemera I encountered was held within a certain
                capitalist logic, images and documents bound to the notion of commodity fetishism—foregrounding glamor
                and symbolic power while the labor and material conditions of their production tended to recede into the
                background. -->

            <br>
            Intuitively, impulsively, I assembled a range of loose photographs, magazine and newspaper clippings.
            When activated by text, fashion images operate as “parameters of
            ‘modern’ behaviour”: fossils of graphic production that remain embedded in the past while gesturing
            toward conditions of contemporaneity.
            <div class="indent">
                I am still searching for some sort of adequate representation for the behaviors that surround desire:
                to feel how it clings to early memory; how it leaves an impression upon a place; how it is made legible
                on the body.

            <div class="indent">
                <!-- The sentence shivers as it is re-made.  -->
                 My practice begins from Barthes' premise, that language, like the written garment, possesses a material density, a sort of embodiment, exceeding its role as description.
                In order to extract text from archival documents, to fashion new modes of encounter for the reader. <img src="media/star8.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon4">

            I imagine text as texture as textile. 
            <div class="indent">
                Working against the myths around the object of desire, where value coheres around glamour or
                symbolic power, I insist on artistic processes that make labor visible. Physical actions function both
                as formal strategies and as embodied assertions: bending and heating through metal, attempting to trace
                the same shadow again and again, recording the tremors of the hand through repetitive markmaking.
                The body lingers in the work.

                Fragments, scraps, shards of language inform materials
                that are then placed under strain by machine tools, as well as my own body. I wonder if new worlds, new dimensions can be reached by affixing characteristics of steel,
                glass, silicone, nylon to texts, and vice versa. By piercing through the skin of words. By burning
                through the surface of a phrase. By the heat of meaning-making. <img src="media/star9.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon4"> I sift through the residue.

                In making physical works that absolve themselves from traditional letterforms, in isolating these
                structures from their original texts, my hope is that the work can hold multiple interpretations for the
                viewer.
                The referent is “duplicated not only by copy or translation, but by exegesis, commentary, and the
                internal
                proliferation of meaning.”

            I like to think of this as a form of inhabited absence—meaning embedding itself in surfaces where

            Desire implies an inherent lack, an absence. To be suspended between states of possession, to either consume or to be consumed. Recently I came across a
            quote by Proust, from <i>Les Plaisirs et les Jours</i> (or, <i>Pleasures and Days</i>, published in 1896): “Desire makes everything blossom;
            possession makes everything wither and fade.”

            Quotes from Roland Barthes' <i>Système de la mode</i> (The Fashion System), published 1967.
            <!-- <br> -->
            Inspired by his writings, I have become increasingly fascinated by the ways words and images lean on one another, and/or resist each
            other.

            Certain phrases published in 60s fashion editorials (specifically, advertisements printed at the height of
            popularity for hosiery and nylon-based lingerie) became the titles of sculptural objects I developed during
            my first year in graduate school. I was interested in how utilizing specific language, originally written to
            insinuate the act of undressing, could change a viewer’s perception of an abstracted body in decay. “To
            shape a smooth, smooth line.” “Soft, shapely, fragile.” “As brief as it is beautiful.”
