                    understand what I had taken from the other girl. It weighed almost nothing in my hands.

            At the age of 25 I wrote and rewrote the details of this recollection, until I was left only with the taste
            of
            certain words.

            On manufactured desire—
            <div class="indent">
                This past year, I drifted in and out of various archives. While working at the International Library of
                Fashion Research last summer, I asked a researcher what drew ordinary visitors into these spaces.
                “Sometimes this is the only way people gain access to this world, through printed matter,” she told me.
                I began watching the way other visitors handled the archival materials: delicately, almost with
                reverence.

            <div class="indent">
                “It is not the object but the name that creates desire; it is not the dream but the meaning that sells,”
                <img src="star2.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon2">
                Barthes writes. Desire circulates through a system that turns garments into aspirations, objects into
                ideals. The larger fashion industry operates as a semiotic field, where items of dress and their
                representations are imbued with cultural significance. A social code of signs and symbols, words and
                images seducing us, conspiring against us.

                We are always left wanting.

            <br>
            It is through textual interpretations, Barthes argues, that fashion first acquires any
            ideological value. Opening a
            fashion magazine to any page, the reader first experiences a garment through its photographed
            representation, then encounters "the same garment, but described, transformed into language; [...] a
            leather belt, with a rose stuck in it, worn above the waist, on a soft shetland dress; this is a written
            garment." <img src="star6.png" alt="icon" class="inline-icon3">
            <div class="indent">
                Unlike the real garment, which has a practical use, the written garment exists entirely to signify
                fashion as a concept. Text and image, the designer’s primary mediums, allow for the reproducibility of
                the object of desire as well as the myths, the constructed meanings, through which longing condenses and
                forms. As designers and as cultural laborers, I often wonder how we are entangled with—and at times,
                implicated within—this system.

            Another memory, though not of my own:
            <div class="indent">
                My parents fell in love at a shoe factory. I was never clear of this past, though I remember my mother
                was just three years younger than I am now. My father picked her up from the train station, in a city
                where she knew no one.

            Last summer I began researching different populations of Chinese migrant textile workers, how claims of
            luxury, value, authenticity depend on laboring bodies largely excluded from dominant systems of cultural
            meaning and recognition.
        </div>
        <div class="primary primarytext-7">
            (7)
            <br>
            Working against the myths around the object of desire, where value coheres around glamour and symbolic
            power while abstracting the material conditions of production, I insist on embodied processes that make
            labor visible in my own practice. Leaving abrasions on metal, attempting to trace the same shadow again
            and again, recording the tremors of the hand through repetitive markmaking. The body lingers in the
            work.
            <div class="indent">
                I begin from Barthes’ premise that language, like the written garment, possesses a material density—an
                embodiment that exceeds its role as mere description. Images and texts within fashion ephemera operate
                as “parameters of ‘modern’ behaviour”: fossils of graphic production that remain embedded in the past
                while gesturing toward conditions of contemporaneity. Thus my process often focuses on extracting text
                from archived documents, reconfiguring phrases to produce new modes of encounter for the reader. Through
                working with this language-as-material I search for the behaviors, the gestures that surround desire:
                how it clings to early memory, how it leaves impressions upon place, how it becomes legible on the body.

            <div class="indent">
                I often think about what is lost through preservation, both within and outside of the archive; what is
                lost through my methods of translation as materials—steel, glass, silicone, nylon—are transferred onto
                text and back again. The affective qualities that are reached by piercing through the skin of words. By
                burning through the surface of a phrase. By the heat of meaning-making.<img src="star9.png"
                    alt="icon" class="inline-icon4"> I sift through the residue.

            In making physical works that absolve themselves from traditional letterforms, in isolating these structures
            from their original texts, my hope is that the work can hold multiple interpretations for the viewer. The
            referent is “duplicated not only by copy or translation, but by exegesis, commentary, and the internal
            proliferation of meaning.”

            I like to think of this as a form of inhabited absence—meaning embedding itself in surfaces where language once was,

            Desire implies an inherent lack, an absence; Proust writes in <i>Les Plaisirs et les Jours</i> (or,
            <i>Pleasures and Days</i>, 1896): “Desire makes everything blossom; possession makes everything
            wither and fade.” I've learned to find pleasure in the absences, the gaps, the holes, the in-betweens, the
            unknowable.

            Quotes from Roland Barthes' <i>Système de la mode</i> (The Fashion System), published 1967.
            <!-- <br> -->
            Inspired by his writings, I have become increasingly fascinated by the ways words and images lean on one
            another, and/or resist each
            other.

            Certain phrases published in 60s fashion editorials (specifically, advertisements printed at the height of
            popularity for hosiery and nylon-based lingerie) became the titles of sculptural objects I developed during
            my first year in graduate school. I was interested in how utilizing specific language, originally written to
            insinuate the act of undressing, could change a viewer’s perception of an abstracted body in decay. “To
            shape a smooth, smooth line.” “Soft, shapely, fragile.” “As brief as it is beautiful.”
